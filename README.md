# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Ensemble Learning

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing an ensemble learning approach for cardiovascular disease prediction. It's a reimplementation of a published paper, with improvements that increased the prediction accuracy from 88% to 91.05%.

## Project Overview

Cardiovascular disease remains a significant global health concern. This project aims to enhance early detection through:

1. An ensemble-based approach using 7 classification algorithms
2. Random forest (RF) model for important feature extraction
3. Achieving a 91.05% prediction accuracy (improved from the original 88%)
4. Comparison with existing methodologies
5. Highlighting the KDNN model's performance (91.46% accuracy)

<!-- ## Contents

- `cardiovascular_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook
<!-- - `data/`: Dataset directory (if applicable)
- `models/`: Saved model files (if applicable)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook cardiovascular_disease_prediction.ipynb` -->

## Results

- Ensemble model: 91.05% accuracy
- KDNN model: 91.46% accuracy
- Original paper: 88% accuracy

## Contributions

This project enhances cardiovascular disease prediction by:

- Reimplementing and improving upon a published method
- Providing a comprehensive comparison with existing techniques
